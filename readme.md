## About Q-UP

The following is the describes of Q-UP's application's motivations and its domain.

### Description

Q-UP is an online queue management solution that allows users to queue from home. We hope this application will have 
great impact in the fight against COVID-19 as it will allow for greater social distancing. In addition, we are 
tackling a universal problem which is wasting time in queues. Our application will allow everyone to use their time more 
efficiently and thus lead better lives. We also aim to make our application accessible to the least privileged 
implementing a system to allow users without electronic means to enter the queue.
